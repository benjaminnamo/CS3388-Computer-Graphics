## Bezier Pen Tool
This code is a simple implementation of a spline-based pen tool program that uses bezier curves and C++. It uses the open-source openGL library GLFW for creating and handling windows, and basic mathematics for calculating distance between points and drawing curves.


## Textured Mesh Renderer
The program is a C++ implementation that allows the user to read triangle mesh data from a file to render textured triangle meshes using VBOs and VAOs. The program includes a limited "first-person camera" which moves relatively smoothly using the arrow keys, and a readPLYFile function to handle the vertex properties and faces of 10 PLY files, each with their own bitmap texture.
